We developed an approach to implement the A* algorithm in parallel called GA*. A* is a classical search algorithm that is used for computing the optimal path between a source and a sink node. We develop several data structures, optimized for use in parallel applications, and designed an algorithm that allows us to run A* efficiently on a GPU. We implemented a serial version of A* and sequential version of the GA* algorithm. While we made many attempts at creating GA* in CUDA, we were ultimately unsuccessful in this endeavor. We applied the A* problem to a slider game. We demonstrate the solution generated by our algorithm in a visual demonstration of the solution to the sliding game.
